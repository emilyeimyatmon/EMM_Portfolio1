      <h3>Introduction and Rationale</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The theme of this data story is the growing mental health crisis among students and young adults,
          and specifically the intolerable stress derived from trying to balance life in academic,
          professional, and personal spheres. At an age when "burnout" is a cliché, facts and figures
          on stress and anxiety and their effects are abundant. Bare figures, however, do not carry an
          emotional point of connection between numbers and individuals, and are seen as abstract and removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rationale for this project was to go beyond simply presenting the data and instead
          “put a face to the facts” by bringing a relatable, character-driven narrative. By concentrating
          the story on one character, “Emily,” the data is put to a face and a place, where it is no longer
          a set of figures but an experienced state of struggle, discovery, and rehabilitation.
          The goal is to ensure that viewers empathize and see a tangible, positive path ahead for
          individuals who can recognize their own situations through Emily’s journey.
        </p>

    <section id="method">
      <h3>Method and Storytelling Technique</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The chosen narrative style is a one-page scrollytelling infographic. It is ideally suited
          to lead the reader through a linear story while organically including data visualizations
          in meaningful locations around the story. The narrative follows a classic three-act structure:
          the beginning with extreme stress, the turning point and seeking answers, and the conclusion
          becoming a balanced life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visualizations do not merely appear but are embedded within the narrative. For example,
          a donut chart shows the reasons for Emily's stress when she was worst off, and a radar chart
          provides a powerful “before and after” view of her life quality, reinforcing the climax
          and conclusion of the narrative. This technique helps ensure that the information tells
          the story, not the other way around.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="design-iterations">
      <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The project involved three iterations. The first was a paper-based low-fidelity storyboard
          that described how Emily's story would flow and the key emotions affecting her. This used
          basic stick-figure illustrations and mock chart boxes, focusing on captions that were easy
          to read and emotionally evocative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second phase moved to the digital wireframing stage. Design tools were used to plan
          the layout of the scrollytelling page. Chart types were chosen based on what they needed
          to show (for example, a donut chart to show composition and a line chart to show change
          over time). Replacement data points from university well-being surveys and mental-health
          research were selected to ground the story in real numbers. The final and most critical
          task was to build the high-fidelity interactive infographic, using a professional but friendly
          colour palette and applying minimal, usable UI design principles.
        </p>
      </div>

    <section id="iteration1">
      <h3>Iteration 1: Stress Management Mind Mapping</h3>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            Even before Emily could start to implement any solution, she needed to identify the problem.
            This meant taking the loose, overwhelming feeling of stress and encapsulating it visually.
          </p>
          <p>
            The root concept of <strong>Stress Management</strong> is placed in the middle of the page.
            Branches extend out to split up the root causes (Identify), coping Strategies (Techniques,
            Support, Delegate), and prevention approaches (Prevention / Time Management).
          </p>
          <p>
            This simple act of mind mapping—sketching the complex web that connects work or school,
            relationships, money, health, and available support—was a crucial step. It transformed
            a vague, paralysing emotional state into a clear, manageable visual problem that could be
            tackled strategically.
