    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I selected the Singapore Census 2020 interactive infographics produced by the Department of Statistics
            as my inspiration example. I appreciate this example because it transforms a vast dataset—the national
            census—into visually appealing and comprehensible representations. Rather than sifting through lengthy
            reports, users can effortlessly investigate critical trends regarding languages, households, and population.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will discuss the reasons for my interest in the Census 2020 infographics, the content they contain, their
            relevance to our class, and a few potential enhancements.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>About the Census 2020 Infographics</h2>
        <p>
            The Census of Population is the most comprehensive survey in Singapore, and it is administered every ten years.
            Data on demographics, households, housing, education, employment, and languages are collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            These findings are presented on the Census 2020 interactive site through infographics, charts, and iconography
            instead of long text-heavy reports. Key sections include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education and Language</strong>: literacy rates, highest qualifications, and languages spoken at home.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="figure">

        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Religion</strong>: distribution of major religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism,
                Taoism, and those who do not practice any religion. This helps explain the cultural and social makeup
                of the population.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Transport</strong>: commuting patterns, travel modes, and average travel times for work or school.</li>

        </div>

            <li>
                <strong>Functional Limitations</strong>: information about residents who experience difficulty with basic activities such as
                mobility, hearing, vision, or communication, which supports planning for ageing and disability services.
            </li>

        </div>

        </ul>

        

        <p>
            The interface is interactive: users can navigate visuals, compare categories, and see how indicators change over time.
            For example, the visuals show that Singapore’s population is ageing and that average family size is decreasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach converts a substantial dataset into a user-friendly format that is accessible to policymakers,
            students, and curious citizens.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why It’s Interesting</h2>
        <p>
            This example is intriguing because it demonstrates the effectiveness of visual communication. It breaks down
            extensive census data into straightforward, interactive infographics. Rather than lengthy reports, users can
            quickly identify key trends, making the information useful for policymakers, businesses, educators, and the public.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Inspiration for Our Class</h2>
        <p>
            This inspiration connects directly to Business Analytics and AI. It reminds us that analysis is only half of the
            job; equally important is sharing insights clearly. Even the most advanced statistical tools are limited if
            decision-makers cannot understand the results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Design choices—colour, icons, layout, and typography—shape how people read and interpret data. An effective
            dashboard makes key findings stand out. After studying this example, I am thinking more intentionally about how to
            present analysis in a way that is both easy to understand and meaningful for the audience.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Improvements</h2>
        <p>The current site is strong, but there are opportunities to enhance it further:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add predictive features such as population forecasts.</li>
            <li>Allow users to build their own comparisons by year, demographic group, or neighbourhood.</li>
            <li>Integrate AI-generated narrative summaries that highlight the most important changes.</li>
            <li>Include global comparisons to show how Singapore’s trends relate to broader regional or world patterns.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The most important lesson from this example is that complex facts become useful when they are turned into simple,
            interactive stories. It encourages me to apply the same ideas in my own projects—going beyond raw numbers to create
            dashboards and visualizations that clearly show what the data means and how it can be used.
